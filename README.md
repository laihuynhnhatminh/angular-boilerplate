# Note
This project is created as a boilerplate for my own Angular projects.
- Default styling lib will be PrimeNg(https://primeng.org/). There will be branch with other libs. (Main focus is Materials, PrimeNG, Ant and Tailwinds)
- Will be updated per Angular major version update.
- This repo is for my own usage, I will take any advices to improve them. However advices should only be to improve the repo overall not just for a single usage or such, if you want to improve it in your own way, do fork the repo and update it as you see fit.
