# To Be Updated:
- Front End Unit Test or Automation Test integration
- Update Deployment support - deployment env(Firebase?, vercel?)
- CI/CD - Linter, build check and then deployment
- Update webpack (code splitting, asset management, module bundling, optimization - module concat, tree shaking)
- Update better security and handling user authentication rather than saving token to Local/Session storage.
